# techdegree-project-4
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle themed word guessing game written using Object Oriented Programming methods in Javascript.

### Classes
This application uses two classes: 
- **Game** - this creates a new game with methods to allow you to control the game and it's state.
- **Phrase** - This creates a new phrase and provides methods to retrieve information about it.


##Exceeds Expectations

### Keypress option
I've added in code to allow the user to use their keyboard to type in the letters instead of clicking the on-screen keyboard
### HTML and Styling
I've updated the HTML to include a logo image to help illustrate the theme of the phrases the user will be guessing.

For styling, I've added a few ID selectors for the logo image to help style it. I've also changed the color palette to match the theme.
